description: Justin Bagley is an evolutionary biologist and postdoctoral researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University interested in using and developing genetics-driven approaches (among others) and computational tools (bioinformatics scripts/pipelines) to understand processes shaping the diversity, distributions, and adaptive evolution of species through space and time.

Justin Bagley is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the
[Department of Biology](https://biology.vcu.edu)
at Virginia Commonwealth University;
research in ecological and evolutionary genetics of animals
and plants in North America and the Neotropics; developer of
[PIrANHA](https://github.com/justincbagley/PIrANHA), [RADish](https://github.com/justincbagley/RADish),
and other repositories for analyzing population genomic
and phylogenomic datasets.

After receiving his BS and MSc degrees in [Biology](https://bsc.ua.edu)
from The University of Alabama in 2004 and 2004, respectively, he
received his PhD in [Integrative Biology](http://biology.byu.edu) in 2014, from 
Brigham Young University (BYU) for his work on comparative phylogeography 
and species delimitation in Central American freshwater fishes for his 
work under PhD advisor [Jerry Johnson](https://lifesciences.byu.edu/Directories/FacultyStaff/ctl/FacultyProfile/mid/5712/NetID/jbj59).
He was a postdoctoral fellow with [Francisco Langeani]() and [Guarino Colli](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guarino_Colli) and 
at the Universidade de Bras√≠lia's [Departamento de Zoologia](http://research.marshfieldclinic.org) 
in the capital of Brazil, 2015&ndash;2017. In 2017, he moved to 
[Virginia Commonwealth University](https://www.vcu.edu),
where he is now a Postdoctoral Scholar in [Andrew Eckert's](LINK) 
Plant Evolutionary Genetics Laboratory.

Justin is an evolutionary biologist focusing on problems in molecular ecology 
and biodiversity science from the perspectives of genetics and 
genomics &ndash; particularly the analysis of genome-wide SNP data to understand 
patterns and processes of evolutionary diversification. A key area of research integrated 
with all other projects is 'phylogeography', the study of the geographical distributions 
of genetic lineages within and among closely related species. Phylogeography presents an 
extensive toolkit that Justin integrates with data and tools for studying speciation, 
adaptation (e.g. environmental association genetics), and hybridization. Organismally 
his training has largely had a focus on teleost freshwater fishes; however, recently he has 
been focusing on studying population structure, adaptation, and ecological speciation in 
North American and South American forest trees including [southwestern white pine](LINK) 
and [quaking aspen](LINK). Justin has also focused the last couple of years on developing 
practical open-source code and bioinformatics pipelines for analyzing genome-wide SNP data 
from genomics experiments with ddRADseq and GBS datasets generated using NGS on reduced 
genome libraries.

Justin is a reviewer for _Molecular Ecology_, _Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution_, 
_PeerJ_, _Proceedings of the Royal Society B_, and a dozen other journals in ecology and 
evolutionary biology.
