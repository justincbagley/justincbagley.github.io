description: Justin C. Bagley is an evolutionary biologist and postdoctoral researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University interested in using and developing genetics-driven approaches (among others) and computational tools (bioinformatics scripts/pipelines) to understand processes shaping the diversity, distributions, and adaptive evolution of species through space and time.

Justin C. Bagley is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Department of Biology](https://biology.vcu.edu)
at Virginia Commonwealth University; Senior Research Associate in the [Departamento de Zoologia](https://zoo.unb.br) 
at Universidade de Brasília; researcher in ecological and evolutionary genetics of animals
and plants in North America and the Neotropics; developer of [PIrANHA](https://github.com/justincbagley/PIrANHA), 
[RADish](https://github.com/justincbagley/RADish), and other repositories for analyzing population genomic
and phylogenomic datasets.

After receiving his BS and MSc degrees in [Biology](https://bsc.ua.edu) from The University of 
Alabama in 2004 and 2008, he received his PhD in [Integrative Biology](http://biology.byu.edu) 
in 2014, from Brigham Young University for his work on comparative phylogeography 
and species delimitation in Central American freshwater fishes under PhD advisor [Jerry Johnson](https://lifesciences.byu.edu/Directories/FacultyStaff/ctl/FacultyProfile/mid/5712/NetID/jbj59).
He was a postdoctoral fellow with [Francisco Langeani]() and [Guarino Colli](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guarino_Colli) 
at the Universidade de Brasília's [Departamento de Zoologia](https://zoo.unb.br) 
in the capital of Brazil, 2015&ndash;2017. In 2017, he moved to [Virginia Commonwealth University](https://www.vcu.edu),
where he is now a Postdoctoral Scholar in [Andrew Eckert's](LINK) Plant Evolutionary Genetics Laboratory.

Justin is an evolutionary biologist focusing on problems in molecular ecology and biodiversity 
science from the perspectives of genetics and genomics &ndash; particularly the analysis of 
genome-wide SNP data to understand patterns and processes of evolutionary diversification. A key 
area of research integrated with all other projects is 'phylogeography', which 
presents an extensive toolkit that Justin integrates with data and tools for studying speciation, 
adaptation (e.g. environmental association genetics), and hybridization. Organismally 
his training has largely focused on teleost freshwater fishes; however, recently he has been 
focusing on studying population structure, adaptation, and ecological speciation in North American 
and South American forest trees including [southwestern white pine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_strobiformis) 
and [quaking aspen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populus_tremuloides). Justin has also focused the 
last couple of years on developing practical open-source code and bioinformatics pipelines for 
analyzing genome-wide SNP data from ddRADseq and GBS experimentsusing NGS on reduced genome libraries.

Justin is a reviewer for _Molecular Ecology_, _Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution_, _PeerJ_, 
_Proceedings of the Royal Society B_, and a dozen other journals in ecology and evolutionary biology.
