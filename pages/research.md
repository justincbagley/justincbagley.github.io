I am interested in how historical and ecological processes act to shape the spatial and 
temporal distributions of biodiversity in freshwater and terrestrial environments. Much of 
my work has focused on **1)** using **molecular phylogeography and species delimitation** to better 
understand population structure and history, species limits, and the role of historical 
biogeographical processes in shaping species distributions and community assembly in 
Neotropical biodiversity ‘hotspots’. However, high-throughput sequencing methods and 
bioinformatics have advanced rapidly, providing tools that I have actively used during 
the last few years to improve my phylogeographic and phylogenetic inferences and expand my 
research into **2)** disentangling the interplay between genetic drift, natural selection, and 
gene flow (hybridization) during **speciation and local adaptation**. This latter focus includes 
studying the ecological and genetic bases of adaptation to challenging environments and 
ecological gradients, and will contribute to future genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
approaches combining genomic and phenotypic datasets to understand the genetic architecture 
of ecologically important traits.

Current projects focus on evolutionary and ecological genomics of North American and 
Neotropical _freshwater fishes_ (tetras, catfishes, cichlids, and livebearers) and _forest 
trees_ (white pines, quaking aspen, and Chilean pine). Within the Neotropics, I am mainly 
interested in uncovering drivers of biodiversity in the Mesoamerica (Central America) 
and Brazilian Cerrado biodiversity 'hotspots'.

## <a name="phylogeog"></a>phylogeography of freshwater & terrestrial ecosystems

**Phylogeography**, the study of the geographical distributions of genetic lineages within and 
among closely related species, has assumed a central role in molecular ecology for inferring 
historical and ecological processes influencing species distributions and genetic diversity. 
Along with collaborators from throughout the U.S. and Brazil, I have been involved in a number 
of projects using this approach, in single-species and comparative (multispecies) contexts, 
to improve our understanding of diversification in North American and Neotropical species 
assemblages.

### <a name="specadapt"></a>genomics of speciation & local adaptation, with implications for climate change

Understanding where and how barriers to gene flow arise, and new species boundaries are formed 
and maintained, is a central goal of evolutionary biology. The study of this general process, or 
'speciation', presents numerous challenges and requires integrative perspectives taking into 
account geographical factors (biogeography) and range dynamics, niche evolution, as well as
the evolution of neutral and adaptive genetic variation in the context of demographic history. 
I have become interested in the different ways in which plant versus animal systems can reveal 
different aspects of the speciation

### <a name="software"></a>code & bioinformatics pipelines

The rapid growth of high-throughput sequencing technologies and their use in molecular ecology 
has precipitated a need for practical code and software solutions to the challenges presented by 
the ensuing deluge of genome-wide DNA sequence data.
