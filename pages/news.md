Check this page regularly for updates about what Justin and his collaborators have been up 
to lately, including news about research progress, travel, meetings and other events.

**September 2, 2017** - Mitra has submitted our manuscript on ecological speciation in white 
pines and it is now Under Review at Molecular Ecology! Fingers crossed! The manuscript, entitled, 
"The role of hybridization during ecological divergence of southwestern white pine, _Pinus strobiformis_, 
and limber pine, P. flexilis", has also been submitted to the preprint server bioArxiv, where 
it is freely available to the public here.

**August 24, 2017** - Our paper entitled, "Strategies for improving approximate Bayesian 
computation tests for synchronous diversification", led by Isaac Overcast and co-authored 
by myself and Mike Hickerson, has been accepted and published in BMC Evolutionary Biology. 
Congratulations Isaac and Mike on pulling this revision together, and thanks for involving 
me in the testing of this new method for comparative phylogeography!! Check the paper out 
here.

**June 23â€“27, 2017** - Justin and the Eckert lab are attending the Evolution 2017 Meetings 
(joint SSE, ASN, and SSB meetings) in Portland, OR. We look forward to learning cutting edge 
science, seeing friends, forging new collaborations, and giving great presentations of our 
hard-eared research. Justin is presenting ddRAD-seq phylogeography results from his Brazilian 
postdoc, as well as his new VCU pine tree postdoc, on Sunday & Monday. He tweeted out his 
schedule Wednesday morning, en route to Portland State University. Keep watching us on Twitter 
(@JBagz1, @iowensis, @evolMM) for more updates about #Evol2017!

**April 1, 2017** - Justin has officially started his new job in the Eckert Lab, located in 
the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Department of Biology! He will be part of a 
broader NSF MacroSystems Biology project studying the ecological and evolutionary genomics 
of southwestern white pine (and related species of white pines), including studies of intrinsic 
versus extrinsic factors during ecological speciation, SNP-based population genomics and 
hybridization, and local and regional adaptation of SWWP populations to high-elevation (montane) 
and longitudinal environmental gradients.

**March 29, 2017** - Justin and Flor moved the family to Richmond, VA to start new jobs at 
Virginia Commonwealth University. Justin was awarded a postdoctoral scholar position that 
is part of a ~$500,000 portion of a $4 million NSF MacroSystems Biology grant!

**June 6, 2016** - Our manuscript on Amatitlania convict cichlid phylogeography and Bayesian 
species delimitation is now accepted at the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society!  
Congrats to Justin and his co-authors Wilfredo Matamoros, Caleb McMahan, Michi Tobler, 
Prosanta Chakrabarty, and Jerry Johnson on the first paper stemming from their group 
collaboration on the phylogeography of Central American freshwater fishes. The picture 
at the top right of this page is a convict cichlid. Hopefully, this group will continue 
to collaborate on great things in the near future!

**June 2, 2016** - Justin completed and submitted the revised version of our manuscript on 
phylogeography and species delimitation in Amatitlania 'convict cichlids' to BJLS. Fingers 
crossed! This has been a year-long revision process, given interruptions from Justin's fieldwork 
and other activities related to his current postdoc position.
