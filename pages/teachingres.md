**Resources for Developing Lecture Courses**
Everyone wants to “design smart lectures.”  Here are links to some nice short videos from 
the University of Minnesota Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) Mini Workshop on designing 
lectures that can help us do this: video set 1 – Examples, video set 2 – Overview (to be 
watched in this order).  Requires Adobe Flash 6 plug-in.  While designing lectures, it is 
also important to understand the questions and objectives of education.  One way to develop 
your understanding of these topics is to read about Bloom’s Taxonomy and be aware of ways 
to facilitate the highest levels of learning–analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and creation
–in the classroom.

**Active Learning Techniques**
Since becoming a buzzword in education in the 1980s and 1990s, “active learning” remains a 
hot topic at all levels of educational literature and practice, being implemented in primary 
through university teaching.  Active learning essentially refers to any and all teaching 
methods that engage students to think about the material without passively listening to 
lecture (or multimedia) content.  Several research studies suggest that active learning is 
better than simply lecturing students, and many educators including the majority of university 
professors use active learning techniques as a more effective way of “guiding” students 
towards “learning goals”.  Consistent with the immense popularity of active learning, there 
are numerous resources online that can help university professors design and implement active 
learning methods.  Here is a short list of links to resources that I have found and used thus 
far in my career.

Active Learning Techniques at the Brigham Young University Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL)

Active learning on Wikipedia

Tips for building interactivity during lectures from the Carnegie Mellon University Eberly Center

The Field-tested Learning Assessment Guide (FLAG) is also a great site to visit.  This website provides detailed information on a variety of active learning techniques, including concept mapping, minute papers, and portfolios.
